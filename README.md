# SHA-256 Anti-Pattern Cryptographic Analysis

## üîç Overview
I had the idea that prime factors might move the data into regions that are identifiable if I undid the bitshifting that occurs in sha256.
This tool tests that theory...

- Predictable patterns in prime factorizations
- Non-random clustering in hash outputs  
- Exploitable algebraic structure in block processing
- Cross-round correlations in double SHA-256

## üö® Potential Impact

If successful, this analysis could reveal:

- **Bitcoin Security Vulnerabilities** - Weaknesses in double SHA-256 mining and transactions
- **Wallet Generation Flaws** - Predictable patterns in BIP39 seed generation
- **Address Prediction** - Non-random structure in Bitcoin address creation
- **General SHA-256 Weaknesses** - Fundamental flaws affecting all applications

## üî¨ Technical Approach

### Anti-Pattern Detection Strategy

The program implements **inverse bit-shift compensation**:

```cpp
// Cancel SHA-256's rotr operations
compensated = rotl(compensated, 7);   // Compensate for rotr(7) in Œ≥‚ÇÄ
compensated = rotl(compensated, 18);  // Compensate for rotr(18) in Œ≥‚ÇÄ
compensated ^= (word << 3);           // Compensate for >> 3 in Œ≥‚ÇÄ
```

### Block-Level Analysis

Instead of analyzing individual hash values, we examine:
- **Complete 512-bit block processing**
- **Round-by-round state evolution**
- **Word expansion patterns (W[16-63])**
- **Cross-block relationships**

### Prime Factorization Scoring

Enhanced weighting system captures cryptographically relevant properties:
- Bitcoin-specific constants (21M supply, 2016 blocks, secp256k1 proximity)
- Special prime types (Sophie Germain, safe primes, twin primes)
- Elliptic curve mathematics (primes ‚â° 3 mod 4)
- Cryptographic standards (RSA exponents, DH parameters)

### Usage

When you run the program, you'll be prompted to select analysis scale:

```
Select anti-pattern analysis scale:
1. Quick Test (5,000 samples) - ~3 minutes

## üìö Background & Theory

### The Bit-Shift Hypothesis

SHA-256 uses several bit rotation operations:
- **œÉ‚ÇÄ**: `rotr(x, 2) ‚äï rotr(x, 13) ‚äï rotr(x, 22)`
- **œÉ‚ÇÅ**: `rotr(x, 6) ‚äï rotr(x, 11) ‚äï rotr(x, 25)`  
- **Œ≥‚ÇÄ**: `rotr(x, 7) ‚äï rotr(x, 18) ‚äï (x >> 3)`
- **Œ≥‚ÇÅ**: `rotr(x, 17) ‚äï rotr(x, 19) ‚äï (x >> 10)`

**Hypothesis**: These operations might not fully mask underlying algebraic relationships. By applying inverse operations, we test whether the original mathematical structure becomes visible.

### Prime Factorization Analysis

**Why Prime Factors?**
- Primes are the fundamental building blocks of all integers
- Non-random prime distributions could indicate exploitable structure  
- Cryptographic applications often rely on prime-related mathematical assumptions
- Bitcoin's elliptic curve cryptography has specific prime-related properties

### Regional Clustering Theory

**Concept**: If SHA-256 has hidden structure, outputs might cluster in predictable regions of the 32-bit output space rather than being uniformly distributed.
